Built using AWS Lambda, S3, and API gateway 

## Purpose: to practice...

### Serverless Computing and Cloud Architecture:
  - Designed and implemented a serverless application using AWS Lambda, S3, and API Gateway.
  - Utilized asynchronous and event-driven application design.

### Database Management and Integration:
  - Set up and managed a MySQL database (RDS) to track user data and job statuses.
  - Integrated database operations with serverless functions.
    
### Programming and Debugging:
  - Wrote Python scripts for cloud-based tasks and handling non-standard libraries.
  - Utilized AWS CloudShell and Lambda layers for dependencies.
  - Debugged with tools like AWS CloudWatch and testing API endpoints.

### API Design and Testing:
  - Built a REST API with methods to handle user interaction, such as uploading and polling for results.
  - Implemented asynchronous operations through job statuses and polling mechanisms.

### Client-Server Interaction:
  - Developed a client application to interact with the API for uploading files and retrieving results.
  - Handled exceptions and implemented automated polling in the client-side code.
